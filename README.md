# Manage List of Places Using Node.js Web Server With Express
## Background
This is a very basic starter web server accessed with http://localhost:3000 .

It uses the Express Node.js module and runs on hardcoded port 3000.

## Behavior
* Server: TBD
* Browser: TBD

## Setup
### Prerequisites
1. Node.js
1. Node package manager 

### Using
1. Check out repository.
1. Run npm install in checked out folder.
1. Run the web server using npm:
    * npm run dev (TypeScript with update monitoring for core .ts files)
    * npm run prod-test (Build + run from JavaScript without update monitoring)
    * Other options in package.json 
1. Access in browser at http://localhost:3000

## Directory Structure
* Core
    * README.md: this file
    * src directory: TypeScript source files
        * index.ts: entry point for dev server assumed by scripts
    * package.json: core configuration including dependencies and scripts
    * nodemon.json: configuration to support live updating (restart server) when .ts files are updates
    * tsconfig.json: TypeScript configuration, including specifying source and compile directies
    * .eslintsrc: linter core configuration
    * .eslintignore: linter ignore configuration (preconfigured to ignore node_modules)
* Generated by npm install
    * package-lock.json: used for tracking node dependency versuibs to ensure consistent behavior (should be committed on new projects, but doesn't make sense for a template)
    * node_modules directory: node modules
* Generated by JS compile
    * lib directory: JavaScript compiled files
    * lib/index.js: entry point for "prod" server assumed by scripts 

## Resources
* Based on my nodejs-basic-express repository, which has its own list of resources

## Future Ideas
* Clean script
* Configurable port (registry or configuration file?)
* Debugging (with or without VS Code)
* Incorporate VS Code Recipes template: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-recipes/
* Customize linter
* Update for express-generate/express 4 structure (or other generator)
